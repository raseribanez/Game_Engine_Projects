Gamemaker Studio Notes
========================

I wanted to say a little bit about how much this program has helped me progress and better my knowledge of programming!

apologies for my brain dribbling....

I have been learning programming for about a year - since I was given A Raspberry Pi and discovered Python was not just
a reptilian animal. I'g getting there and I run a Python facebook community and do tutorials you can find on my other 
repositories It has been a rollercoaster of ups and downs as I try to make the most of free resources and learning aids

Anyway,

As I focus on game development, I have found that using game engines can be a very efficient and fast way to develop games. 
especially if you are not already a programming mastermind

By using a game engine - (Gamemaker Studio), I have been able to really take a step back and learn about the structure and 
mechanics of building a game. but also speed things right up to get good results quicker. 

I have learnt a lot by developing this way - and surprisingly it has really helped me to better understand 2D game development 
in Python as-well

I am happy to answer any questions and help in any way I can. If you use these games I'd like to know - just so I know if it was helpful
or can improve anything - not important though - all the work I have done has been with openly available software and resources, so you 
can easily do this stuff yourself if you wanted, just takes time and patience!

I appreciate ANY feedback and constructive criticism - and improvements!
