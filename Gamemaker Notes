Gamemaker Studio Notes
========================

I wanted to say a little bit about how much this program has helped me progress and better my knowledge of programming!

Readme file wouldn't allow my epic essay length - so here it is, my brain dribbling....

I have been learning programming for about a year - since I was given A Raspberry Pi and discovered Python was not just
a reptilian animal.

It has been a rollercoaster of ups and downs as I try to make th emost of free resources and learning aids

Anyway,

As I focus on game development, I have found that using game engines can be a very efficient and fast way to develop games. 
especially if you are not already a programming Yoda

By using a game engine - (Gamemaker Studio), I have been able to really take a step back and learn about the structure and 
mechanics of building a game. I have learnt a lot by developing this way - and it has really helped me to better understand 
2D game development in a full on coding language (Python) as-well. What I have learned in Gamemaker Studio is transferable to 
ANY language, it is just a case of different syntax! 

I am happy to answer any questions and help in any way I can. If you use these games please drop me an email or message to 
let me know - just so I know it was helpful - not important though - all the work I have done is with openly available software and 
resources....so you can easily do this stuff yourself if you wanted, just takes time and patience!

I appreciate ANY feedback and constructive criticism - and improvements!
