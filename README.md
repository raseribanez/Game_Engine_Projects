GML Language

Here is a collection of little games and levels I have made to get a feel for the Game Engine software.

Most will be either clones of classic games, or my own take on popular games. As I learn all I can I will be improving the 
quality and detail within my games.

The games posted here are in GML language
Feel free to use them as templates, or as learning aids.

As I focus on game development, I have found that using game engines can be a very efficient and fast way to develop games.
By using a game engine - like Gamemaker Studio and YoYo, I have been able to really learn about the structure and mechanics 
of building a game. I have learnt a lot by developing this way - and it has really helped me to better understand 2D game development
in a full on coding language (Python) as-well. What I have learned in Gamemaker Studio is transferable to ANY language, it is just a case of different syntax! 

It is surprising because I thought using a  Game engine would be a step away from learning programming in code, but although GML is a little easier syntax-wise, it is surprisingly similar in the way games need to be structured. Plus it's a breath of air in comparison -
to be able to build the game basics so quickly...within minutes , using Gamemaker you can have a game level made and character running
around colliding with things. If you want to improve your programming, or want to learn more about programming, and Game Development...
Gamemaker is an Awesome tool!

I am happy to answer any questions and help in any way I can. If you use these games please drop me an email or message to 
let me know - just so I know it was helpful - not important though - all the work I have done is openly available software and 
resources....so you can easily do this stuff yourself if you wanted anyway!

I appreciate ANY feedback and constructive criticism - and improvements!

Enjoy
