# Game_Engine_Projects
GML Language

Here is a collection of little games and levels I have made to get a feel for the Game Engine software.

Most will be either clones of classic games, or my own take on popular games. As I learn all I can I will be improving the 
quality and detail within my games.

The games posted here are in GML language
Feel free to use them as templates, or as learning aids.

Enjoy
