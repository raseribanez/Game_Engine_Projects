# Game_Engine_Projects
GML Language

Here is a collection of little games and levels I have made to get a feel for the Game Engine software.

These aren't epic games by todays standards - but they are examples of my work as I progress
I want others to be able to use my examples to aid their own learning in Game Development

Most will be either clones of classic games, or my own take on popular games. As I learn all I can I will be improving the 
quality and detail within my games - also some of the games here were made by following tutorial videos on youtube, then customizing to my own preferences.

Heres the links to make them yourself:

Both have amazing channels for Game Development, with full step-by-step Gamemaker tutorials

The games posted here are in GML language
Feel free to use them as templates, or as learning aids.

Enjoy
