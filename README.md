# Game_Engine_Projects
GML Language

As I focus on game development, I have found that using game engines can be a very efficient and fast way to develop games.
By using a game engine - like Gamemaker Studio and YoYo, I have been able to really learn about the structure and mechanics 
of building a game. I have learnt a lot by developing this way - and it has really helped me to understand game development
in a full on code language. What I have learned in Gamemaker Studio is transferable to ANY language, it is just a case of different syntax!

Here is a collection of little games and levels I have made to get a feel for the Game Engine software.

Most will be either clones of classic games, or my own take on popular games. As I learn all I can I will be improving the 
quality and detail within my games.

The games posted here are in GML language

Feel free to use them as templates, or as learning aids.

I am happy to answer any questions and help in any way I can. If you use these games please drop me an email or message to 
let me know.

I appreciate ANY feedback and constructive criticism - and improvements!
